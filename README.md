C++ projects submissions from Software Analysis and Design 2.
Summary of course:  Design and analysis of algorithms and abstract data types. Topics covered: data structures with
                    related algorithms. abstraction, algorithm complexity, performance analysis and the tradeoffs between
                    running time, storage size, clarity and extensibility, Templates, Inheritance, Polymorphism, pointers, and
                    dynamic memory allocation.
